# Regulation
- The default language for this project is **ENGLISH**. You can use Chinese, but it **must** have a translated version at the next line
- Have prefix of UC which stands for `Underchess`
- `<##>` is a Xcode mark, which places a place holder with the description text between `#`
- Every Scene should have a `UC<#SceneName#>ViewController.swift` and a `UC<#SceneName#>View.swift`
- Use good names for **EVERYTHING**
	- Should 
		- Be descriptive, should be almost the same as reading an article that shows what it is about
	- Should ***NOT***
		- Be abbreviation, like "ULS" stands for "User Login Scene"
		- Be Chinese Pinyin, like "denglujiemian"
		- Be languages *OTHER* than English
- Common idioms
	- Don't merge so many sentence into one
- ...
- Unless SpriteKit gets to work, the project will use `CA` stuff instead of `SK`
- Should save data frequently without influencing performance
- It is okay to use Objective-C **only if that's the only solution**
- **Last** sentence of **each** paragraph can end without period(`.`) in this project

## Use of storyboard
### LaunchScreen.storyboard 
**Critical: Do not make any changes to this file without posting the reason and tell the group members!**
### Main.sotryboard
1. Initial Scene is called `Splash`.
2. All other scenes should be present from **code**, **not segues** *(**only if it is necessary**)*

# Program Life Cycle

# Localization
## String
	func NSLocalizedString(
			// Identifier
		key: String,
			// Where to find the string
		tableName: String,
		bundle: NSBundle,
			// Value for string when it is not found
		value: String,
			// Instruction for translators
		comment: String
	) -> String
### Example
	let localString = NSLocalizedString(
		"Foo", 
		comment:"This string is shown when..."
	)
### Default
 `bundle` is `NSBundle.mainBundle()` and `tableName` is `Localizable`

## Formatted String
*Bad Example*
	let string = String.localizedSringWithFormat(
		NSLocalizedString(
			"Score is %f",
			comment:"Give the score"
		), 
		theNumber
	)

### Formatters
- Number
	- `let formatter = NSNumberFormatter()`
	- Displaying
	- `let stringWithFormatToDisplay = formatter.stringFromNumber()`
	- Parsing
	- ` formatter.numberStyle = <#NSNumberFormatterStyle#>
	let parsedNumber = formatter.numberFromString(<#userInputtedString#>)`
	- DecimalStyle ...
- Date
	- ShortStyle
	- MediumStyle
	- LongStyle
	- FullStyle
	- NoStyle
- ...
## Export
Editor --> Export For Localization

## Debug
`<#Target#>` --> Edit Scheme --> Duplicate --> Rename to `underchess <#language#>` --> Options --> Application Language

## Customized type 
**That can be stored in NSUserDefaults*
	struct Type{
		static/*Not sure is it is needed*/ let subType1 = <#AnyObject#> /*or other things*/
	}
